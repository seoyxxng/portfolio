                <p>Earth's Mightiest Heroes stand as the planet's first line of defense against the most powerful threats in the universe. The Avengers began as a group of extraordinary individuals who were assembled to defeat Loki and his Chitauri army in New York City. Since then, the team has expanded its roster and faced a host of new threats, while dealing with their own turmoil.</p>

                <p>The Avengers Initiative was the brainchild of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury. He first approached Tony Stark with the idea, following Tony’s defeat of Obadiah Stane and his subsequent public announcement that he was Iron Man. Fury kept his eye on several potential members, as Bruce Banner struggled with life as the Hulk, the Asgardian Thor appeared on Earth, and Steve Rogers, AKA World War II hero Captain America, was discovered alive decades after his apparent death. In the meantime, some of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s most skilled members, Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton), were making a name for themselves and impressing Fury.</p>

                <p>After early encounters with Magneto and a harrowing fight with the Shadow King, Charles Xavier realized that evil mutants were a threat to humanity and their own kind alike. Charles dedicated his life to promoting peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans by opening Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
                One of the rechristened Professor X's first pupils was Jean Grey, a young girl whose telepathic abilities developed far too quickly for her mind to handle.
                Xavier subsequently recruited Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, and Angel before formally introducing them to Jean, whom he renamed Marvel Girl. Soon after, Magneto made his public debut by striking at Cape Citadel and seizing control of the military base. Upon hearing the news, Xavier sent the X-Men to confront Magneto and deescalate the military's response. Despite their inexperience, the young X-Men managed to force Magneto into retreat.</p>

                <p>The Guardians of the Galaxy's origins can be traced to Earth native Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, betraying Yondu Udontu and his Ravagers and pre-emptively stealing a valuable Orb they were after. In retaliation, Yondu put a bounty on Quill’s head, which mercenaries Rocket and Groot were eager to claim.
                On Xandar, Quill and Gamora battled over the Orb, as Rocket and Groot intervened to detain Quill. During their skirmish, they were all captured by the Nova Corps and arrested. The four were sent to a high security prison, the Kyln, where they were joined by fellow prisoner Drax, whose family had been killed thanks to Thanos and Ronan. While locked up, the wary partners formulated their escape and a plan to sell the Orb and split the profits. In the wake of their breakout, the five outlaws would all come realize the threat Ronan held, and put their own lives on the line to stop him, in the process becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>

                A decorated and devastating branch of the Kree military, Starforce is comprised of the best and most powerful warriors. Formed by the Kree's Supreme Intelligence to war with the Skrulls, Starforce battles all threats to the Kree way of life.</p>

                <p>The Avengers visited the Kree home world Hala to seek a diplomatic solution to the war between the Shi'ar and the Kree. Earth's solar system had become embroiled in the Kree-Shi'ar conflict by the close proximity of a stargate which allowed passage between the two empires. While on Hala, the Avengers were present at the murder of Kree rulers General Ael-Dan and General Dar-Benn by Shi'ar assassin Deathbird. The Supreme Intelligence reclaimed leadership of the Empire (having secretly facilitated Deathbird's mission), and installed Starforce as an official Kree army.
                Starforce arrested the Avengers and Deathbird. Ronan, most prominent of the Kree judges called Accusers, was added to Starforce's ranks, and accompanied Korath, Shatterax, Supremor and Ultimus to Shi'ar space to assassinate the Shi'ar ruler Lilandra; however, another team of Avengers were in negotiations with the Shi'ar, and they helped the Shi'ar Imperial Guard defeat Starforce.</p>

                <p>S.H.I.E.L.D. is an espionage and security organization that defends Earth and its people from groups that pose advanced technological—and sometimes supernatural or extraterrestrial—threats. S.H.I.E.L.D. is shorthand for the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division. It typically operates under United Nations’ authority and its command structure starts with an executive council of 12 people that represent national and corporate sponsors of the agency. They communicate solely with a director that they choose.</p>

              <div class="subcon" data-aos="fade-right">
                <p class="subt">Earth's Shield</p>
                <p>Tony Stark, the U.S. industrialist, inventor, and Super Hero, spearheaded S.H.I.E.L.D. to combat tyranny and crime across Earth in response to World War II terrorist groups like Hydra. While the original monikers of Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division or Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate do not apply today, each still resonates with its core mission. Stark, with the support of his company Stark Industries, often provided advanced weaponry and combat equipment to the agency, even bringing in mutant inventor Forge and Reed Richards, AKA Mr. Fantastic, to help design S.H.I.E.L.D.’s first Helicarrier. A massive aircraft carrier that supports thousands of personnel and sustains flight at high altitudes with its anti-gravity vortex beam, the Helicarrier can carry out its anti-terrorism goals without being detected. Hydra destroyed the very first Helicarrier, but Stark quickly replaced it. Since then, S.H.I.E.L.D. has had at least one vessel in service throughout most of its history.</p>
